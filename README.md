#### 👋 Hi there, my name's Matthew
#### 💬 I'm a marketer turned data enthusiast
#### 💬 I started in data science and I've now broadened my scope to data engineering
#### 💬 I've recently graduated from AiCore and I'm on the old job hunt looking for a friendly team to join   
#### 🌱 I’m currently learning... how to create a profile README ;)
#### 🌱 Other than that I'm going down bit of a Bayesian rabbit hole (fyi my prior beliefs were that it was round and at least 4ft deep).
#### 📫 Feel free to say hello :) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-m-a847349/)
#### ⚡ Fun fact: I've played chess internationally and one of my hobbies is biochemistry (yeah, not boring at all 😄)
