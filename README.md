#### ğŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name's Matthew
#### ğŸ’¬ I'm a marketer turned data enthusiast
#### ğŸ’¬ I started in data science and I've now broadened my scope to data engineering and application development.
#### ğŸ’¬ I've recently graduated from AiCore and I'm on the old job hunt looking for a friendly team to join   
#### ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning all things functional and distributed with the goal of building an event-driven application that can integrate my data science knowledge   
#### ğŸŒ± Other than that I'm always exploring Bayesian rabbit holes (fyi my prior beliefs include they're round, at least 4ft deep and contain white rabbits)
#### ğŸ“« Feel free to say hello :) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-m-a847349/)
#### âš¡ Fun fact: I've played chess internationally and one of my hobbies is biochemistry (yeah, not boring at allğŸ¤“ğŸ˜„)
