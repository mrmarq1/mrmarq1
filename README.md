#### ğŸ“« Feel free to say hello :) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-m-a847349/)
#### âš¡ Fun fact 1: I've played chess internationally and one of my hobbies is biochemistry (yeah, not boring at allğŸ¤“ğŸ˜„)   
#### âš¡ Fun fact 2: I'm currently exploring concurrent/parallel workflows and the odd Bayesian rabbit hole (fyi my prior beliefs include they're round, at least 4ft deep and contain white rabbits)
